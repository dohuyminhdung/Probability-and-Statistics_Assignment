# Probability-and-Statistics_Assignment
Statistics and Probability asignment, semester 231 from HCMUT. 
This assignment is about solving data-related problems and using linear regression to predict the value of an element based on other elements provided in a CSV file.
Sorry for the messy code. Working with fewer people than a regular team makes everything seem like it's out of control.
We wrote a report explaining the process of completing this assignment in Vietnamese.
